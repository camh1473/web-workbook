    <p>Meet Cameron. Cameron grew up in Dallas, TX. After graduating from Texas State
        University San Marcos in 2012, Cameron moved to Austin in 2014. Cameron reads
        a book a week, is a student at Austin Code Academy, and prefers single speed
        if anybobdy's asking. Like many Austinites, Cameron became an instant taco
        aficionado. His goal is to learn everything he can about coding and become
        an Overlord of Webmastering. </p>
