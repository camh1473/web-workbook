      <p class="white-txt"> I have spent years solving a variety of problems for people ranging from sleep
        deprivation to employee efficiency and morale. Recently I have shifted my
        focus from helping corporations to helping the community. I use Web Development
        skills to build Responsive Apps for minority and Black owned businesses in
        the Austin, TX area. Also, I like to ride my bicycle around town and prefer
        single speed if anybobdy's asking. </p>
